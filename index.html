    <p> Welcome to my blog! My name is <strong><span class= "myBitOfCrazyStyling">Audrey</span></strong> and I’m a French globetrotter passionate about numbers and fashion. I study at <em>EBS Paris</em> but I'm currently in <em>INSEEC London</em> for an exchange.<br>    By networking in San Francisco & London, I’m seeking an internship in the FinTech industry for next January.<br> Through my blog, you will be able to follow my three weeks journey in San Francisco in February 2019.</p>

      Through my studies, I had the opportunity to do a <strong><em>digital expedition</em></strong> in San Francisco for 3 weeks. I was able to attend classes in coding, design & creativity and digital marketing. My journey was built on networking and
      visiting the different districts of the city. During my trip, I visited the most popular neighborhoods of San Francisco such as Haight-Ashbury, Castro, Chinatown, the Mission District and the Marina District. My favorite souvenir was walking, under
      the sun, on the seafront from the Golden Gate to Pier 45. </p>

    <br> We also had the chance invited to visit Silicon Valley and more specifically <span class="Google">G</span> <span class="OO">o</span><span class="O1">o</span><span class="GG">g</span><span class="L">l</span><span class="EE">e</span>, Apple and we
    did a tour of Stanford University. I was impressed of the size of the infrastructures of the university because in France we don't have campuses as wide and well equipped. These visits were very enlightening to understand the atmosphere the GAFA's work
    in and it helps us understand why the Silicon Valley's spririt is fundamental for start-ups.
    <br> Thanks to this trip, I gained independence and self-confidence and I am now prepared for future experiences abroad like an internship or even just a travel. </p>
    <p> To prepare any travel in San Francisco, or anywhere else, I advice you to check-out some Youtube videos to learn about the tips,advices and any information that people give concerning your destination. Before going to San Francisco I watched the video
      linked below to understand and prepare the activities I was going to do there:
